## About PowerShell

A few quick relevant details about PowerShell‚Ä¶

### Which Profile does PowerShell Use?

You can test to see which profile is loaded in PowerShell by opening a PowerShell window and typing `$PROFILE`. My default is:  `$PSHOME\Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1`.

| Profile Type               | Location                                                     |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| All Users, All Host        | `$HOME\Documents\PowerShell\Profile.ps1`                     |
| All Users, Current Host    | `$PSHOME\Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1`                   |
| Current User, All Hosts    | `$HOME\Documents\PowerShell\Profile.ps1`                     |
| Current user, Current Host | `$HOME\Documents\PowerShell\Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1` |

### Add a customized PowerShell prompt

```powershell
function Prompt {
    $env:COMPUTERNAME + "\" + (Get-Location) + "> "
}
```

### Bring up the Help Menu
